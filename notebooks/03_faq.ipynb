    "## Why do I need a GitHub Access Token and how can I get one?\n",
    "The *stable dracor client* uses the GitHub API for some operations, e.g. loading plays from a github repository. Without authentification the number of calls to the GitHub API is limited (see [Github API Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/rate-limit/rate-limit?apiVersion=2022-11-28#about-rate-limits). When adding multiple plays this limit will be exceeded rather quickly. Therefore, you can supply a [Personal Github Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#about-personal-access-tokens) when initializing a `StableDraCor` instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dracor = StableDraCor(github_access_token=github_token)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Personal Access Token log into your GitHub Account and go to `Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)` [(GitHub Settings)](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Click on `Generate new token`and select `Generate new token (classic)`. Normally, you don't have to select any of the boxes, just scroll down and create the token. Don't forget to copy the token (it is the text starting with `ghp...`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either use the token directly in your notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dracor = StableDraCor(github_access_token=\"ghp_12345...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But be careful, your token is like a password and if you want to share your notebook (e.g. add it to a public repo on GitHub) you should not add your token directly to the code. It is safer to use an *environment variable* for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can set an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` when starting your *dracor-sandbox* Docker container by creating an `.env` file in the directory where the `compose.yml` file is located. To this `.env` file add the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GITHUB_TOKEN={your token}\n",
